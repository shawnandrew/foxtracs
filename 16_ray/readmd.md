## History
Ray is an open-source distributed computing framework developed to address the challenges of scaling machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Its development has been marked by several key milestones:

2017: Inception and Initial Release

Ray was introduced by researchers from the University of California, Berkeley’s RISELab in December 2017. The foundational paper, “Ray: A Distributed Framework for Emerging AI Applications,” outlined Ray’s architecture and its ability to handle dynamic task graphs and actor-based computations. (ArXiv)

2018: Performance Enhancements and Community Adoption

In 2018, Ray’s architecture was refined to improve scalability and fault tolerance. The system employed a distributed scheduler and a fault-tolerant store to manage control state, achieving a throughput of over 1.8 million tasks per second. (ArXiv) This performance attracted attention from the ML and AI communities, leading to increased adoption and contributions.

2019-2020: Expansion of Ecosystem and Industry Adoption

During this period, Ray’s ecosystem expanded with the introduction of libraries tailored for specific ML tasks:
	•	Ray Tune: For scalable hyperparameter tuning.
	•	Ray Serve: For model serving.
	•	Ray RLlib: For reinforcement learning.

These additions enhanced Ray’s versatility, making it a comprehensive platform for various ML workloads. Companies like OpenAI and Ant Group began leveraging Ray for large-scale AI applications. (Ray)

2021-Present: Continued Growth and Integration

Ray’s development has continued with a focus on improving usability, performance, and integration with other tools. The community has grown, contributing to a rich ecosystem of integrations and applications. Ray now supports deployment on various platforms, including Kubernetes, and integrates with popular ML frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow. (Ray Documentation)

In summary, Ray has evolved from a research project into a robust, widely-adopted framework for distributed computing in ML and AI, continually adapting to meet the needs of modern AI applications.
