# What is Generative AI?

**Definition:**
Generative AI refers to a subset of artificial intelligence that involves creating new content, such as images, text, music, and more, rather than simply analyzing or interpreting existing data. It uses machine learning models, particularly generative models, to produce outputs that are novel and often indistinguishable from human-created content.

### Key Technologies

1. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):**
   - **Components:** Consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, that are trained together.
   - **Function:** The generator creates fake data, while the discriminator evaluates it against real data. Through this adversarial process, the generator improves its ability to create realistic content.

2. **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):**
   - **Components:** Comprised of an encoder and a decoder.
   - **Function:** The encoder compresses input data into a latent space representation, and the decoder generates new data from this representation, often used for creating images.

3. **Transformer Models:**
   - **Components:** Use self-attention mechanisms to process input data.
   - **Function:** Models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) can generate coherent and contextually relevant text, as well as code, based on large-scale training datasets.

### Applications

1. **Text Generation:**
   - **Example:** OpenAI's GPT-4o and ChatGPT can generate human-like text for applications like chatbots, content creation, and translation.

2. **Image Generation:**
