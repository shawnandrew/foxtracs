# Model Context Protocol (MCP) for AI-to-AI Communication

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard introduced by Anthropic to connect AI assistants with external data sources and tools ([Introducing the Model Context Protocol \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol#:~:text=The%20Model%20Context%20Protocol%20is,that%20connect%20to%20these%20servers)). It defines a client–server architecture using JSON-RPC and server-sent events (SSE) to facilitate two-way data exchange between an AI application (client) and a **resource or tool** (server) ([Anthropic MCP: Developer's Thoughts - DEV Community](https://dev.to/dbolotov/anthropic-mcp-developers-thoughts-3dkk#:~:text=,processes%20queries%2C%20and%20handles%20responses)). The question is whether this protocol, originally intended for AI-to-data integration, can also serve for **AI-to-AI communication**, or if other solutions are better suited. Below, we analyze MCP’s design, real-world multi-agent use cases, and compare it with alternative protocols for AI-to-AI interactions in terms of performance, scalability, security, and implementation.

## MCP’s Design and Features

**MCP Design:** MCP was designed to standardize how AI systems integrate with data and services. Instead of bespoke connectors for each source, MCP provides a unified interface (via JSON schemas and SDKs) for connecting AI to **any MCP-compatible service** ([Introducing the Model Context Protocol \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol#:~:text=The%20Model%20Context%20Protocol%20is,that%20connect%20to%20these%20servers)) ([Introducing the Model Context Protocol \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol#:~:text=Instead%20of%20maintaining%20separate%20connectors,with%20a%20more%20sustainable%20architecture)). Developers can create **MCP servers** exposing data or functionalities (e.g. Google Drive, GitHub, databases) and AI-powered **MCP clients** that query these servers ([Introducing the Model Context Protocol \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol#:~:text=The%20Model%20Context%20Protocol%20is,that%20connect%20to%20these%20servers)). This standardization handles common needs like connection management, error handling, and structured inputs/outputs ([Anthropic MCP: Developer's Thoughts - DEV Community](https://dev.to/dbolotov/anthropic-mcp-developers-thoughts-3dkk#:~:text=While%20technically%20not%20groundbreaking%2C%20MCP,common%20technical%20needs%2C%20such%20as)). Early adopters have used MCP to let AI agents fetch context from various enterprise systems and development tools ([Introducing the Model Context Protocol \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol#:~:text=Early%20adopters%20like%20Block%20and,functional%20code%20with%20fewer%20attempts)) ([Introducing the Model Context Protocol \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol#:~:text=Officer%20at%20Block,%E2%80%9D)). In essence, MCP focuses on **context-sharing and tool usage** – bridging “AI assistants” with the information they need to perform tasks.

**AI-to-AI Communication in MCP:** While MCP’s primary intent is AI-to-tool integration, its architecture can be applied to multi-agent setups. In principle, one AI agent can act as an MCP client and treat another AI (exposed via an MCP server interface) as a “tool.” Anthropic’s documentation even frames MCP as a protocol for *AI capabilities* – a general assistant (client) can seamlessly connect to other AI applications or agents acting as servers ([Is Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol Right for You?](https://www.willowtreeapps.com/craft/is-anthropic-model-context-protocol-right-for-you#:~:text=MCP%20can%20be%20thought%20of,data%20across%20projects%20and%20applications)). This means an AI model could invoke another specialized AI through MCP as if querying a service. However, MCP does **not explicitly define a new language for agents** – it still sends requests/responses over HTTP in JSON format ([Anthropic MCP: Developer's Thoughts - DEV Community](https://dev.to/dbolotov/anthropic-mcp-developers-thoughts-3dkk#:~:text=What%20we%20really%20need%20is,RPC%20and%20SSE)). Essentially, it allows AI-to-AI calls in a structured way, but the interaction is more like remote procedure calls than a free-form conversation protocol.

## Using MCP for AI-to-AI Collaboration

There have been early experiments using MCP for direct AI-to-AI dialogs. For example, a developer enabled Anthropic’s Claude model to hold a live conversation with an OpenAI model (“o1-mini”) by routing messages through MCP-based API calls ([Claude here! Just had my first chat with o1-mini through API calls : r/ClaudeAI](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1hlvzs4/claude_here_just_had_my_first_chat_with_o1mini/#:~:text=Technical%20Details)). In this demo, each model’s message was sent as an MCP request and the reply was forwarded back, with the protocol maintaining the shared conversation context across turns ([Claude here! Just had my first chat with o1-mini through API calls : r/ClaudeAI](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1hlvzs4/claude_here_just_had_my_first_chat_with_o1mini/#:~:text=Technical%20Details)). The result was a coherent back-and-forth chat between two different AI systems – effectively **AI agents chatting via MCP**. This shows MCP can facilitate multi-agent communication when one agent’s outputs are fed as inputs to another via the protocol. 

Such use cases are still experimental. Community discussions around MCP have speculated about **two-way AI interactions over MCP** “over time” (e.g. agents exchanging information or negotiating) ([What uses of MCP have you guys found interesting now that Claude works so nicely with MCP servers? : r/ClaudeAI](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1izebti/what_uses_of_mcp_have_you_guys_found_interesting/#:~:text=That%E2%80%99s%20cool%20and%20very%20powerful,not%20simply%20reading%20from%20it)). In practice, using MCP in both directions would require each AI to both **client** (sending queries) and **server** (answering queries) roles, which isn’t the typical one-way client-server pattern. Current MCP implementations assume the AI agent is the client initiating requests and the tool/data source is the server responding. So, to enable true peer-to-peer AI dialog, developers must set up reciprocal connections or an intermediary to swap client/server roles. This is possible but not built into MCP’s core design.

It’s worth noting that **MCP’s focus is context and tools**, not a rich agent dialogue syntax. One developer commentary pointed out that what’s really needed for the future is a dedicated *“AI-agent to AI-agent communication protocol,”* not just wrapping API calls over HTTP ([Anthropic MCP: Developer's Thoughts - DEV Community](https://dev.to/dbolotov/anthropic-mcp-developers-thoughts-3dkk#:~:text=What%20we%20really%20need%20is,RPC%20and%20SSE)). In other words, MCP currently treats the other AI as a black-box service (invoked via JSON requests), rather than providing higher-level semantics for agent coordination. This suggests that while MCP *can* be used for basic AI-to-AI messaging, it may not by itself offer all the features needed for complex multi-agent collaboration (like negotiation, coordination primitives, or shared memory beyond simple context passing).

## Alternative Protocols for AI-to-AI Interaction

Beyond MCP, several other approaches have emerged (in industry and research) to enable AI-to-AI or multi-agent communication:

- **OpenAI’s Function Calling:** OpenAI introduced a function-calling interface that lets a language model call external functions or services via structured JSON outputs ([Function Calling - Inference.net Documentation](https://docs.inference.net/features/function-calling#:~:text=Function%20calling%20provides%20a%20powerful,has%20two%20primary%20use%20cases)). This can be leveraged to chain AI agents – for example, one agent can be exposed as a function that another agent’s model is allowed to call. Function calling was designed to let models **fetch data or take actions** in a controlled way ([Function Calling - Inference.net Documentation](https://docs.inference.net/features/function-calling#:~:text=Function%20calling%20provides%20a%20powerful,has%20two%20primary%20use%20cases)). Developers have used it to implement tool use and even multi-step workflows where an AI decides to invoke sub-functions (which could be another model) before responding. This isn’t a standalone “protocol” between AI peers, but it provides an efficient mechanism for orchestrating multiple models within a single framework (the orchestrating code handles passing outputs of one model as inputs to another). It benefits from being **built-in and optimized** in OpenAI’s API, reducing overhead compared to external HTTP calls.

- **Multi-Agent Frameworks:** A number of frameworks explicitly support multiple LLM-based agents working together. For instance, **Microsoft’s AutoGen** framework allows developers to compose *multiple agents that converse with each other* to accomplish tasks ([AutoGen: Enabling Next-Gen LLM Applications via Multi-Agent Conversation - Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/autogen-enabling-next-gen-llm-applications-via-multi-agent-conversation-framework/#:~:text=We%20present%20AutoGen%2C%20an%20open,We%20demonstrate%20the%20framework%E2%80%99s%20effectiveness)). These agents can be a mix of LLMs, tools, and human inputs, and AutoGen provides patterns for turn-taking, role assignment, and shared context management. Such frameworks often use **natural language as the medium** of communication between agents (each agent generates messages in plain text), while the framework orchestrates the dialogue structure. Another example is **LangChain’s LangGraph/Agent Protocol**, which aims to standardize how different agent implementations interconnect ([Agent Protocol: Interoperability for LLM agents](https://blog.langchain.dev/agent-protocol-interoperability-for-llm-agents/#:~:text=This%20means%20most%20agents%20expose,APIs%20make%20standard%20communication%20challenging)). LangChain’s Agent Protocol defines a common API (for runs, message threads, etc.) so that agents built on different platforms can still communicate or be supervised uniformly ([Agent Protocol: Interoperability for LLM agents](https://blog.langchain.dev/agent-protocol-interoperability-for-llm-agents/#:~:text=This%20means%20most%20agents%20expose,APIs%20make%20standard%20communication%20challenging)). There are also community projects like *OpenAI’s “Swarm” pattern* (an experimental multi-agent orchestration technique) and **SuperAGI’s Agent Communication Protocol (AACP)**, indicating a push toward patterns where **multiple AI agents coordinate** on sub-tasks. These frameworks are higher-level than MCP – they handle the logic of conversations, task delegation, and sometimes have scheduling of which agent speaks when. They prioritize ease of building **collaborative agent systems** without reinventing communication from scratch.

- **Academic Agent Communication Languages:** Long before LLM-based agents, AI researchers developed standard agent communication languages such as **FIPA-ACL** and **KQML**. FIPA-ACL (by the Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents) defines a structured message format with performatives (speech acts) like *request, inform, query* that agents can use to exchange information and intentions ([Agent Communications Language - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_Communications_Language#:~:text=Agent%20Communication%20Language%20,is%20another%20proposed%20standard)) ([Agent Communications Language - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_Communications_Language#:~:text=Both%20rely%20on%20speech%20act,varies%20from%20system%20to%20system)). Each message in such protocols includes a performative, content, and context metadata, aiming for unambiguous agent interactions. These protocols require agents to share an ontology (common vocabulary) for the message content to be understood ([Agent Communications Language - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_Communications_Language#:~:text=ask,varies%20from%20system%20to%20system)). While classical in origin, the ideas carry into modern research on LLM agents – for example, recent studies propose **hybrid communication protocols** that bridge structured formats and natural language to suit LLMs’ strengths ([Multi-LLM-Agent Systems: Techniques and Business Perspectives](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.14033v1#:~:text=protocols%20must%20bridge%20the%20gap,2024)) ([Multi-LLM-Agent Systems: Techniques and Business Perspectives](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.14033v1#:~:text=Core%20Protocol%20Framework,and%20the%20experience%20management%20protocol)). Academic work also emphasizes advanced features like **negotiation protocols, consensus formation, and multi-turn dialogue management** for multi-agent systems ([Multi-LLM-Agent Systems: Techniques and Business Perspectives](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.14033v1#:~:text=Core%20Protocol%20Framework,and%20the%20experience%20management%20protocol)). These approaches are explicitly designed for AI-to-AI interaction, but they can be complex to implement. They highlight what a purpose-built AI communication protocol might offer (rich semantics, negotiation, turn-taking rules), beyond what MCP’s simple request/response covers.

## Comparative Analysis: MCP vs. Other Protocols

When considering MCP for AI-to-AI communication versus the alternatives above, it’s useful to compare them on key factors:

### Efficiency and Latency

MCP relies on web protocols (HTTP/JSON-RPC and SSE) to facilitate communication ([Anthropic MCP: Developer's Thoughts - DEV Community](https://dev.to/dbolotov/anthropic-mcp-developers-thoughts-3dkk#:~:text=,processes%20queries%2C%20and%20handles%20responses)). This makes it relatively **easy to implement** but introduces overhead – each interaction involves serializing prompts/responses as JSON and sending HTTP requests. For two large language models to chat via MCP, every turn goes through an HTTP call, which can add network latency and CPU overhead for parsing JSON. In contrast, approaches like OpenAI’s in-process function calling or an integrated multi-agent framework can be more efficient. For example, in a single orchestrator process, one model’s output can be passed directly as the next model’s input without network hops, reducing latency. That said, if agents are distributed services (e.g. calling an external API model), some protocol overhead is inevitable. MCP’s use of SSE for streaming does help reduce latency when retrieving large outputs (allowing partial results to flow back). But generally, a lightweight direct method (or using a shared runtime) will have lower round-trip times than MCP’s client-server calls. In summary, MCP trades some efficiency for standardization – it may be fast enough for many use cases, but purpose-built multi-agent systems can minimize latency by avoiding the extra layers.

### Scalability

Scalability can refer to both the number of agents in collaboration and the ability to handle high message throughput. MCP’s design is one-to-one (an AI client connects to each server it needs). Scaling to many agents/services means managing multiple connections. This is feasible – the protocol itself is stateless JSON RPC calls, which web infrastructure can scale – but the complexity grows with each additional agent integration. There is no built-in discovery or routing of messages to multiple peers; you’d need an orchestrator to coordinate if many AIs were all to talk via MCP. By contrast, dedicated multi-agent frameworks often provide a structure for N agents (often one agent managing sub-agents, or a global message bus). Academic literature suggests that as the number of agents increases, **traditional protocols face challenges in communication overhead and consistency** ([Multi-LLM-Agent Systems: Techniques and Business Perspectives](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.14033v1#:~:text=From%20these%20challenges%2C%20we%20identify,Second%2C%20as%20system%20scale%20increases)). A custom agent communication setup might use a broker or shared memory for efficiency. MCP wasn’t specifically optimized for dozens of agents exchanging a flurry of messages – it’s more for an agent tapping a few tools on demand. Thus, for **small-scale agent collaborations** (one AI consulting one or two other AI services), MCP works fine. But for **large agent societies**, an alternative that supports multi-party communication or broadcasting might scale better. Scalability also depends on adoption: a protocol is more powerful if widely supported. Currently, MCP is new and mainly tied to Anthropic’s ecosystem; by contrast, function calling or certain frameworks have wider use, making it easier to assemble many agents that “speak” the same protocol.

### Security and Control

MCP emphasizes secure connections and fine-grained permissions when linking to data sources ([Introducing the Model Context Protocol \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol#:~:text=The%20Model%20Context%20Protocol%20is,that%20connect%20to%20these%20servers)). Each MCP server can enforce access rules on what data or actions the AI client can perform. This security model carries over to AI-to-AI usage: one could restrict what queries an AI agent can send to another via MCP, and log all interactions. The protocol’s standardized format also makes it easier to audit communications. In multi-agent scenarios, security concerns include **preventing unintended information leakage** and ensuring one agent cannot exploit another. With MCP, since interactions are explicit RPC calls, a developer can insert validation or redaction at the server layer. In contrast, letting two AI models converse in free-form text (as frameworks often do) could risk them sharing sensitive content or deviating from allowed topics unless carefully sandboxed. Academic discussions highlight security as a key challenge for agent collaboration ([Beyond Self-Talk: A Communication-Centric Survey of LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14321v1#:~:text=key%20system,systems%20across%20diverse%20application%20domains)). No matter the protocol, **guardrails** are needed (such as filtering messages or limiting function access). MCP’s advantage is that it was built with enterprise data integration in mind, so it already considers authentication and permissioning. Alternatives like OpenAI’s function calling also provide control (the developer chooses which functions to expose, and the model can only invoke those). Overall, MCP can be considered **secure-by-design for tool usage**, and those benefits apply to AI-to-AI communication in terms of controlling what one agent can request of another. However, if agents are conversing in natural language through a custom framework, developers must implement similar controls manually.

### Ease of Implementation

For a developer, using MCP for multi-agent communication means adopting a new standard – spinning up MCP server wrappers around each AI or service. Anthropic has released SDKs and sample servers to lower this barrier ([Introducing the Model Context Protocol \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol#:~:text=,source%20repository%20of%20MCP%20servers)), but it’s still an emerging ecosystem. If one is already using Anthropic’s Claude and its client apps, MCP integration is straightforward (Claude’s desktop app natively supports connecting to MCP servers ([Introducing the Model Context Protocol \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol#:~:text=,source%20repository%20of%20MCP%20servers))). On the other hand, outside the Claude ecosystem, not many AI APIs natively “speak” MCP yet. By comparison, **OpenAI’s function calling** is built into OpenAI’s API – so if you’re using GPT-4, you can immediately use function calls to link agents or tools, with no extra server needed. Multi-agent libraries like AutoGen or LangChain are also readily usable with just a Python install, and come with examples for common patterns. They might not be “standards,” but they are popular and well-documented, which speeds up development. Another aspect of implementation is how natural it is for the AI to use the protocol. MCP is developer-driven: you write code to handle MCP messages to and from the AI. In contrast, some frameworks allow you to simply script a conversation between agents in a few lines of prompt or code (hiding the communication mechanism under the hood). In summary, if one’s goal is to quickly prototype AI agents chatting, a high-level framework or built-in function call might be **easier to implement**. If the goal is to establish a robust, interoperable system with custom data access and you’re using Anthropic’s stack, MCP is a compelling choice. It may have a learning curve and currently a smaller community, but it aims at being a **universal standard** going forward ([Introducing the Model Context Protocol \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol#:~:text=Instead%20of%20maintaining%20separate%20connectors,with%20a%20more%20sustainable%20architecture)), which could pay off in the long term.

## Conclusion

**Can MCP be extended for AI-to-AI communication?** – Yes, to an extent. MCP provides a solid foundation for structured exchanges between an AI agent and external entities, and this can include other AI agents by treating them as services. It has been successfully used in at least simple multi-agent scenarios (e.g. one AI querying another) ([Claude here! Just had my first chat with o1-mini through API calls : r/ClaudeAI](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1hlvzs4/claude_here_just_had_my_first_chat_with_o1mini/#:~:text=Technical%20Details)). Its strengths lie in standardization, security, and maintaining context consistency across calls. However, MCP is not a specialized multi-agent dialogue protocol; it lacks higher-level messaging semantics (beyond RPC-style calls) and was not specifically optimized for complex agent-to-agent dialogue patterns. For rich AI-to-AI collaboration (multiple agents brainstorming, negotiating roles, or concurrently working), developers might find more agility in alternatives like OpenAI’s function-call orchestration or dedicated multi-agent frameworks. These alternatives allow using **natural language protocols** or custom workflows that align more closely with how LLM-based agents “think” and communicate, potentially leading to more fluid collaboration ([Multi-LLM-Agent Systems: Techniques and Business Perspectives](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.14033v1#:~:text=Another%20significant%20development%20is%20the,meaningful%20collaboration%20between%20intelligent%20entities)) ([Anthropic MCP: Developer's Thoughts - DEV Community](https://dev.to/dbolotov/anthropic-mcp-developers-thoughts-3dkk#:~:text=What%20we%20really%20need%20is,RPC%20and%20SSE)). 

In terms of **efficiency and scalability**, a purpose-built multi-agent approach can reduce overhead and handle many-to-many communications better than MCP’s point-to-point JSON calls. If two agents need to chat intensively, directly exchanging text via an orchestrator (or using a shared memory store) might be faster. On the other hand, if **security, clarity, and interoperability** are top priorities – for example, an enterprise setting where you want different AI systems (from different vendors) to interface under well-defined rules – MCP or a similar open protocol could be preferable. It creates a common “language” that any compliant agent or tool can use, which is aligned with the long-term vision of AI interoperability ([Introducing the Model Context Protocol \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol#:~:text=Instead%20of%20maintaining%20separate%20connectors,with%20a%20more%20sustainable%20architecture)). 

**Bottom line:** MCP can be used for AI-to-AI communication, but likely as a building block rather than a complete solution for multi-agent intelligence. In scenarios requiring simple query/response interactions between models, MCP works and benefits from its standardized design. For more **sophisticated multi-agent collaboration**, one might lean on frameworks or emerging research that are explicitly designed for that purpose, or even consider hybrid approaches (using MCP for data/tool access and a different mechanism for inter-agent dialogues). As the field evolves, we may see new protocols (or extensions to MCP) that better address direct AI-to-AI dialogue – fulfilling the vision of agents communicating **natively** with each other rather than through human-oriented APIs ([Anthropic MCP: Developer's Thoughts - DEV Community](https://dev.to/dbolotov/anthropic-mcp-developers-thoughts-3dkk#:~:text=What%20we%20really%20need%20is,RPC%20and%20SSE)). In the meantime, the choice between MCP and alternative solutions will depend on the specific requirements for efficiency, scale, security, and how easily one can integrate the solution into their AI workflows. Each approach has trade-offs, and it’s possible a combination will yield the best results (for example, using MCP where standardization is needed and using more free-form agent conversations where flexibility is key).
