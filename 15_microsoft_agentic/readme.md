# Microsoft Agentic AI

Microsoft is streamlining its agentic AI development frameworks by integrating the multi-agent runtime technology from its research project, AutoGen, into the production-ready Semantic Kernel SDK. This strategic move aims to provide developers with a unified, enterprise-grade platform for building sophisticated AI agent systems.

**AutoGen and Semantic Kernel: An Overview**

- **AutoGen**: Developed by Microsoft Research's AI Frontiers Lab, AutoGen is an open-source framework designed to simplify the creation and orchestration of event-driven, distributed agentic applications. It enables multiple large language models (LLMs), tools, and advanced multi-agent design patterns to collaborate in completing complex tasks autonomously or with human oversight. AutoGen supports both C# and Python programming languages. 

- **Semantic Kernel**: This production-ready SDK integrates LLMs and data stores into applications, facilitating the development of product-scale generative AI solutions. Semantic Kernel supports multiple programming languages, including C#, Python, and Java, and features Agent and Process Frameworks in preview, enabling the construction of single-agent and multi-agent solutions. 

**Integration Strategy**

Microsoft plans to align the multi-agent runtime from AutoGen, known as autogen-core, with Semantic Kernel. **This integration is expected to be available in early 2025**, providing a seamless transition for customers experimenting with cutting-edge agentic patterns into an enterprise-ready and supported environment. The collaboration between the AutoGen and Semantic Kernel teams aims to converge on similar design principles for orchestrating multiple agents, resulting in a unified multi-agent runtime. 

**Guidance for Developers**

- **Experimentation**: Developers interested in exploring multi-agent systems and advanced agentic patterns can continue to experiment with AutoGen. The framework remains open-source and community-supported, serving as a platform for ideation and experimentation. 

- **Production Applications**: For building agent applications requiring enterprise-grade support, developers are advised to use Semantic Kernel. With its stable version 1.0 release across .NET, Python, and Java, Semantic Kernel offers a commitment to stability and non-breaking changes, providing confidence in developing enterprise-ready AI applications. 

**Resources for Getting Started**

Microsoft provides several resources to assist developers in adopting these frameworks:

- **Semantic Kernel**:
