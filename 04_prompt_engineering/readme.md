# Prompt Engineering for AI Agents

**We will start with [Learn Prompting](https://learnprompting.org/docs/introduction) and then moving to the [Prompt Engineering Guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/) as your skills and knowledge evolve.**

## Basic Learning Path

1. [Prompt Engineering](https://learnprompting.org/docs/basics/prompt_engineering)
2. [Instruction prompting](https://learnprompting.org/docs/basics/instructions)
3. [Assigning Roles](https://learnprompting.org/docs/basics/roles)
4. [Shot-Based Prompting](https://learnprompting.org/docs/basics/few_shot)
5. [Parts of a Prompt: Understanding the Key Elements](https://learnprompting.org/docs/basics/prompt_structure)
6. [How to Create Effective Prompts: Essential Tips and Best Practices](https://learnprompting.org/docs/basics/ai_prompt_tips)


## Advanced Papers

Techniques for prompting LLMs in more sophisticated ways began to take off in 2022. They coalesced in moves toward agentic AI early this year. Foundational examples of this body of work include:

1. [Chain of Thought prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903), which asks LLMs to think step by step
2. [Self-consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11171), which prompts a model to generate several responses and pick the one thatâ€™s most consistent with the others
3. [ReAct](https://research.google/blog/react-synergizing-reasoning-and-acting-in-language-models/), which interleaves reasoning and action steps to accomplish a goal
4. [Self-Refine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17651), which enables an agent to reflect on its own output
5. [Reflexion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366), which enables a model to act, evaluate, reflect, and repeat.
6. [Test-time compute](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03314), which increases the amount of processing power allotted to inference
