### Note for Chain-of-Thought Prompting

OpenAI's o1 model represents a significant advancement in AI reasoning capabilities by integrating internal chain-of-thought (CoT) processing directly into its architecture. This design enables o1 to autonomously decompose complex problems into sequential steps, enhancing its performance in tasks requiring intricate reasoning, such as mathematics, science, and coding. 

In contrast, earlier models like GPT-4o necessitate explicit CoT prompting from users to achieve similar step-by-step reasoning. Users had to craft detailed prompts guiding the model through each reasoning stage, which could be labor-intensive and less efficient. With o1, this manual prompting is largely unnecessary, as the model is trained to internally generate and follow a logical sequence of thoughts to arrive at solutions. 

This internalization of CoT reasoning in o1 leads to several practical implications:

- **Simplified Prompting**: Users can employ straightforward prompts without the need for elaborate step-by-step instructions, as o1 autonomously manages the reasoning process. 

- **Enhanced Accuracy**: By systematically processing each component of a problem, o1 reduces the likelihood of errors, resulting in more accurate and reliable outputs. 

- **Improved Efficiency**: The model's ability to internally handle complex reasoning tasks streamlines interactions, saving users time and effort in prompt engineering. 

In summary, while both GPT-4o with external CoT prompting and o1 aim to enhance reasoning capabilities, o1's built-in CoT processing offers a more seamless and efficient approach to tackling complex problems, reducing the need for user intervention in the reasoning process.

 

## Advanced Papers

Techniques for prompting LLMs in more sophisticated ways began to take off in 2022. They coalesced in moves toward agentic AI early this year. Foundational examples of this body of work include:

1. [Chain of Thought prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903), which asks LLMs to think step by step
2. [Self-consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11171), which prompts a model to generate several responses and pick the one thatâ€™s most consistent with the others
3. [ReAct](https://research.google/blog/react-synergizing-reasoning-and-acting-in-language-models/), which interleaves reasoning and action steps to accomplish a goal
4. [Self-Refine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17651), which enables an agent to reflect on its own output
5. [Reflexion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366), which enables a model to act, evaluate, reflect, and repeat.
6. [Test-time compute](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03314), which increases the amount of processing power allotted to inference
