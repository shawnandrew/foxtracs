## Steps to Create a Custom Panaversity GPT

### **Prepare Documents**

- **Syllabus Details**: Upload the syllabus details PDF.
- **Generative AI Fundamentals**: Upload the generative AI fundamentals PDF.

#### **Convert GitHub Repositories to PDFs**

Use the `git_to_pdf_converter` code to convert relevant GitHub repositories into PDFs. This code is provided in this repository and can be used locally with Docker and Poetry.
### **Upload Documents**
Once the PDFs are generated, upload them to your custom GPT. Ensure that the GPT is configured to prioritize information from these documents.
The instructions for the GPT are included in the instructions.txt file in this directory.
