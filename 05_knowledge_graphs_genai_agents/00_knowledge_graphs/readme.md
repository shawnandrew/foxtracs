# Knowledge Graphs

**What Are Knowledge Graphs?**

A knowledge graph is a structured representation of information that captures entities (such as people, places, or concepts) and the relationships between them. In a knowledge graph:

- **Nodes** represent entities or concepts.
- **Edges** represent relationships or associations between these entities.

This graph-based structure allows for a flexible and interconnected way to model complex real-world information. Knowledge graphs can encompass vast amounts of data and are often used to integrate information from multiple sources, providing a unified view of knowledge.
