Altman defined the five levels of AI development – the first stage being the **chatbots**, followed by **reasoners**, which the company says has now been achieved. The next phases are **agents**, **innovators capable of scientific discovery**, and **fully autonomous organisations**.

With the depth of OpenAI’s o1 capabilities, it looks like level 3 of AI is almost here. The superior o1 model with improved reasoning and problem-solving capabilities, literally taking more time to think and process, has opened the doors for OpenAI’s gateway to AGI. The model is using reinforcement learning over an auto-generated chain of thought.

Considering o1 models’ superior reasoning capabilities, it is possible that their next level of AI is hinting towards fully autonomous agents. “The agentic experiences that we expect this technology [level 2] to eventually enable, I think will be quite impactful,” said Altman.

While Altman did not make any specific mention of when your AGI will be achieved, the path towards it is now clearer than ever. With level three, i.e. agents already being at play, the big tech is only two steps shy of achieving the ultimate goal.

## OpenAI’s o1 Model

In order to understand AI Agents [Level 3] we must have a firm grasp at reasoners [Level 2] i.e. OpenAI’s o1 Reasoning Models.
