# Agentic Design Patterns

[Design Patterns](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rakeshgohel01_not-all-ai-agents-are-created-equally-here-activity-7276242517904302080-gsTJ?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

Agentic Design Patterns refer to recurring solutions or approaches used to structure autonomous AI agents. These patterns define how agents reason, act, and interact with their environment, other agents, or users to achieve specific goals. They are conceptual frameworks that guide the design and implementation of AI agents to maximize efficiency, adaptability, and performance in complex, dynamic environments.

The term "agentic" emphasizes the autonomy of these systems, meaning they can operate independently, make decisions, and perform actions without constant human intervention.
