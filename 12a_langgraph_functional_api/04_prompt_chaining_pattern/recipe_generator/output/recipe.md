This recipe delivers a classic Italian appetizer bursting with fresh, vibrant flavors. The combination of ripe tomatoes, fragrant basil, creamy mozzarella, and garlic-infused olive oil atop toasted bread is simply irresistible.

**Yields:** 6-8 servings
**Prep time:** 20 minutes
**Cook time:** 5-7 minutes

**Ingredients:**

*   **For the Bruschetta:**
    *   1 baguette, sliced into 1/2-inch thick rounds
    *   4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided
    *   2 cloves garlic, minced
    *   1 pound ripe tomatoes (Roma or heirloom varieties recommended), diced
    *   1/4 cup fresh basil leaves, thinly sliced (chiffonade)
    *   8 ounces fresh mozzarella, preferably buffalo mozzarella, drained and sliced or torn into bite-sized pieces
    *   Balsamic glaze (optional, for drizzling)
    *   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

**Equipment:**

*   Baking sheet
*   Small bowl
*   Cutting board
*   Knife
*   Garlic press (optional)

**Instructions:**

**1. Prepare the Garlic-Infused Oil:**

*   In a small bowl, combine 2 tablespoons of olive oil with the minced garlic. Let this mixture sit for at least 10 minutes to allow the garlic to infuse the oil. This will create a flavorful base for your bruschetta.

**2. Toast the Bread:**

*   Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).
*   Arrange the baguette slices on a baking sheet.
*   Brush each slice lightly with the garlic-infused olive oil.
*   Bake for 5-7 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown and lightly toasted. Keep a close eye on them to prevent burning.

**3. Prepare the Tomato Mixture:**

*   While the bread is toasting, prepare the tomato mixture. In a medium bowl, combine the diced tomatoes, sliced basil, the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil, salt, and pepper.  Gently toss to combine.  Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.

**4. Assemble the Bruschetta:**

*   Once the bread is toasted, remove it from the oven.
*   Spoon a generous amount of the tomato mixture onto each toasted bread slice.
*   Top with a slice or pieces of fresh mozzarella.

**5. Final Touches and Serving:**

*   If desired, drizzle the bruschetta with balsamic glaze for a touch of sweetness and acidity.
*   Serve immediately.  The bruschetta is best enjoyed while the bread is still warm and the tomatoes are fresh.

**Serving Tips:**

*   **Variety:**  Offer different types of mozzarella, such as burrata, for a richer and creamier experience.
*   **Bread Choice:**  Use a rustic Italian bread for a more substantial bruschetta.
*   **Garlic Rub:**  For a more intense garlic flavor, rub a raw garlic clove over the toasted bread before adding the toppings.
*   **Heat Level:**  Add a pinch of red pepper flakes to the tomato mixture for a touch of heat.
*   **Wine Pairing:**  Serve with a crisp white wine like Pinot Grigio or a light-bodied red like Chianti.
*   **Presentation:**  Arrange the bruschetta on a platter and garnish with fresh basil sprigs for an elegant presentation.
*   **Make Ahead:** The tomato mixture can be made a few hours in advance, but assemble the bruschetta just before serving to prevent the bread from becoming soggy.
