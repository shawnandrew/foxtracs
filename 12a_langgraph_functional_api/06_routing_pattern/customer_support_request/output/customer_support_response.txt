Okay, I understand your internet connection is dropping every few minutes, even after restarting your router. Let's try a few things to pinpoint the problem. Please follow these steps carefully:

**1. Check Your Modem:**

*   **Modem Lights:** Examine the lights on your modem (the device that connects your house to your internet service provider's network).  Typically, you'll have a power light, a receive light (or downstream light), a send light (or upstream light), and an internet light.
    *   **What to look for:**
        *   **Power:** Should be solid green. If not, check the power cable and outlet.
        *   **Receive/Downstream & Send/Upstream:** Should be solid or blinking steadily.  If they are off or blinking erratically, it indicates a problem with the signal from your ISP.
        *   **Internet:** Should be solid. If it's off or blinking, it means the modem isn't successfully connected to the internet.
*   **Modem Restart:** Sometimes, just like the router, the modem needs a restart too.
    *   **How to restart:** Unplug the power cable from the *modem* (not the router) for 60 seconds. Then, plug it back in and wait for it to fully power on.  This can take a few minutes.  Watch the lights to see when it's connected.
    *   **Important:** After restarting the modem, restart your router again. This ensures both devices establish a fresh connection.

**2. Directly Connect to the Modem (Bypass the Router):**

This is a crucial step to determine if the problem lies with your router or with the internet connection itself.

*   **How to:**
    1.  **Disconnect your router:** Unplug the Ethernet cable that connects your router to the modem.
    2.  **Connect a computer directly to the modem:** Use an Ethernet cable to connect your computer directly to the modem.
    3.  **Restart your computer:** This will force your computer to request a new IP address from the modem.
    4.  **Test your internet connection:** Open a web browser and try to access a website.
*   **What to look for:**
    *   **If the internet works fine when connected directly to the modem:** This indicates the problem is likely with your router. Proceed to step 4 (Router Troubleshooting).
    *   **If the internet still drops when connected directly to the modem:** This strongly suggests the problem is with your internet service itself. Proceed to step 5 (Contact Your ISP).

**3. Check Ethernet Cables:**

*   **Inspect the cables:** Make sure all Ethernet cables connecting your modem, router, and computer are securely plugged in and in good condition. Look for any visible damage, such as frayed wires or bent connectors.
*   **Try different cables:** If possible, try using different Ethernet cables to rule out a faulty cable as the cause of the problem.

**4. Router Troubleshooting (If Direct Connection Worked):**

Since the internet worked when directly connected to the modem, the router is likely the culprit.

*   **Check Router Firmware:** Make sure your router has the latest firmware.  Outdated firmware can cause connectivity issues.
    *   **How to:** The process varies depending on your router model. Consult your router's manual or the manufacturer's website for instructions on how to update the firmware.  You'll usually access the router's settings through a web browser by typing its IP address (often 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1) into the address bar.
*   **Check Router Settings:**
    *   **DNS Servers:** Sometimes, using custom DNS servers can improve connection stability. Try setting your router's DNS settings to use Google's Public DNS servers:
        *   Primary DNS: 8.8.8.8
        *   Secondary DNS: 8.8.4.4
    *   **Wireless Interference:** If you're using Wi-Fi, try changing the Wi-Fi channel in your router settings.  Experiment with different channels (1, 6, and 11 are common) to see if it improves stability.  Use a Wi-Fi analyzer app on your smartphone to see which channels are least congested in your area.
*   **Router Reset to Factory Defaults:** As a last resort (and after backing up any custom settings), you can try resetting your router to its factory default settings.  This will erase all your configurations, so be prepared to reconfigure your Wi-Fi name, password, etc.
    *   **How to:**  Typically, there's a small recessed button on the back of the router.  Use a paperclip or pin to press and hold the button for about 10-15 seconds while the router is powered on.  Consult your router's manual for specific instructions.

**5. Contact Your ISP (If Direct Connection Still Dropped):**

If the internet is still dropping when you're directly connected to the modem, the problem is almost certainly with your internet service provider (ISP).

*   **What to tell them:**
    *   Explain that your internet connection is dropping frequently.
    *   Tell them you've already restarted your modem and router.
    *   Inform them that you've tested the connection by connecting a computer directly to the modem, and the problem persists.
    *   Ask them to check the signal strength and stability to your modem and to look for any issues with their equipment or network in your area.  They may need to run diagnostics remotely or send a technician to your home.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Document everything:** Keep a record of when the connection drops, what you've tried, and the results. This information will be helpful when talking to your ISP.
*   **Be patient:** Troubleshooting network issues can take time and require a systematic approach.
*   **Security:** Always use strong passwords for your Wi-Fi network and router administration.

Please work through these steps, and let me know the results of each step. The more information you can provide, the better I can assist you in resolving this issue. Good luck!
