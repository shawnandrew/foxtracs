# Bidirectional Q&A Chatbots

We will be developing chatbots with bidirectional Q&A interface where both the AI and user can ask questions, similar to how human conversations naturally flow. AI can both ask and answer questions, making interactions feel more like a dialogue.

**Initiating a conversation**

AI might ask the first question to initiate a conversation, for example to build a user profile.

**Counter Question**

A user might ask, "What's your favorite movie?" and AI could respond with a question, "Have you seen 'Blade Runner 2049'?"

**Educational Tools:**

**Quizzing:** An AI tutor might ask a question to start a quiz or review session.

**Concept explanation:** If the user is struggling with a topic, the AI might ask, "Can you explain what you understand so far?" to gauge their knowledge level.
