# Agentia Fitness Management Agent Project

Below is a suggested **eighth project** in your **Agentia** learning path, replacing the healthcare triage idea with a **Fitness Management Agent**. This system will help users set and track fitness goals, integrate with wearable devices or activity data, and provide personalized workout recommendations—while maintaining a **human-in-the-loop** for key decisions and oversight.

---

## Project Overview

1. **Goal**  
   - Develop a **Fitness Management Agent** that interacts with users to:
     1. Collect and analyze activity data (e.g., steps taken, calories burned).  
     2. Set and track fitness goals (e.g., weight loss, muscle gain, running milestones).  
     3. Provide personalized workout or nutrition suggestions.  
   - Maintain a **human-in-the-loop** approach for important changes, such as adjusting goals, verifying health constraints, or deciding on advanced workout plans.

2. **Key Components**  
   1. **Front-End Orchestration Agent** (existing)  
      - Primary point of contact for all user queries and commands.  
   2. **Greeting Agent** (existing)  
      - Handles simple greetings and small talk.  
   3. **User Preference Agent** (existing)  
      - Stores user-specific info (e.g., daily step goals, dietary restrictions, availability for workouts).  
   4. **Knowledge Graph Agent** (optional)  
      - Can store relationships between workout routines, muscle groups, fitness goals, or user progress history.  
   5. **Mail Processing Agent** (optional)  
      - Sends out daily or weekly progress summaries, motivational emails, or reminders about workout sessions.  
   6. **Fitness Management Agent** **(New)**  
      - Integrates with wearable device APIs or a mock data source (e.g., steps, heart rate, calories).  
      - Uses an **LLM** for conversation-based coaching, suggesting workout routines or meal plans based on user goals and preferences.  
      - Provides a **human-in-the-loop** step for major changes (e.g., significantly altering a user’s workout plan or riskier fitness advice).

3. **Value Proposition**  
   - Demonstrates how multi-agent systems and LLM-based orchestration can improve user engagement and success in health and fitness.  
   - Highlights the need for disclaimers and user consent, ensuring the user understands this is **general guidance** rather than strict medical advice.

## 1. Plan the Architecture

1. **Service Layout**  
   - The **Fitness Management Agent** runs as its own service/container.  
   - It connects to:  
     - An **activity data** source (wearable device API, Apple HealthKit, Google Fit, or a mock data generator).  
     - (Optionally) a **nutrition database** or meal-planning API for macro/micronutrient information.

2. **Communication Mechanisms**  
   - Continue to use **HTTP**, **gRPC**, or a **message bus** for inter-agent requests.  
   - The Fitness Agent’s **LLM function-calling** might define tools like:  
     - **GetDailyActivity**(userId)  
     - **SuggestWorkout**(goal, fitnessLevel, availableEquipment)  
     - **LogWorkout**(workoutType, duration, userId)  
     - **SetGoal**(goalType, targetValue, timeframe)

3. **Human-in-the-Loop and Disclaimers**  
   - Users must confirm major changes to their fitness plan (e.g., large increases in exercise intensity).  
   - The system should **disclaim**: “Always consult a healthcare professional before beginning any new exercise routine, especially if you have medical conditions.”

## 2. Fitness Management Agent

### 2.1 Responsibilities

1. **Gather and Analyze User Data**  
   - Retrieve daily step counts, heart rate data, workout logs, or calorie consumption from the integrated sources.  
   - Summarize user progress: “You walked 5,000 steps today—down 10% from yesterday.”

2. **Provide Workout Recommendations**  
   - Based on user preferences and goals (weight loss, endurance, muscle building), suggest routines (e.g., cardio, HIIT, strength training).  
   - Factor in the user’s available equipment (gym machines vs. at-home workouts), time constraints, or injury history.

3. **Nutritional Guidance** (Optional)  
   - Suggest meal plans or daily calorie/macro targets if integrated with a nutrition service or user-provided data.

4. **Goal Setting and Tracking**  
   - Let users set monthly or weekly targets (e.g., run 10km in one session, lose 2 pounds, or bench press a certain weight).  
   - Track performance over time, sending reminders or motivational prompts.

5. **Draft and Approval Mechanism**  
   - For significant changes (e.g., “Increase running distance from 2km to 5km tomorrow”), the agent returns a **draft** prompting user confirmation to ensure safety and feasibility.


## 3. Front-End Orchestration Agent: Extended Logic

1. **Identify Fitness Management Requests**  
   - If the user’s input is about workouts, diets, or step tracking, route it to the **Fitness Management Agent**.  
   - Otherwise, delegate to the relevant existing agent (Greeting, Finance, Project Management, etc.).

2. **Draft Confirmation**  
   - If the Fitness Agent proposes a new workout plan or drastically changes goals, the **Front-End** displays the plan and collects user approval.  
   - User can confirm, modify, or reject.

3. **Fallback**  
   - If the user’s fitness question is too vague or contradictory (e.g., “I want to gain muscle while on a 1,000-calorie diet”), the Fitness Agent can prompt clarifying questions.

## 4. Demonstration Scenario

1. **User**: “Hi, how many steps have I walked today?”  
   - **Front-End** → **Greeting Agent** (if it can handle small talk) or directly to **Fitness Management Agent**.  
   - The Fitness Agent calls `GetDailyActivity(userId=1234)` to retrieve step count from the wearable API.  
   - Returns: “You’ve walked 4,500 steps today.”  

2. **User**: “I want to get to 10,000 steps a day. Can you help me do that?”  
   - **Front-End** → **Fitness Management Agent** → The agent calculates a plan to gradually increase step targets over two weeks.  
   - Returns a draft plan: “Increase your daily step goal by 1,000 every 3 days. Approve?”  

3. **User**: “Yes, that sounds good.”  
   - **Front-End** → Approves → The Fitness Agent finalizes the plan and logs: “Daily step goal set to 5,500 today, will reach 10,000 in two weeks.”

4. **User**: “Suggest a quick 30-minute at-home workout.”  
   - **Front-End** → **Fitness Management Agent** → Calls `SuggestWorkout(duration=30, equipment='bodyweight')`.  
   - Returns: “Try a circuit of push-ups, squats, planks, and lunges, 3 sets each, with short rest intervals.”

## 5. Deployment and Testing

1. **Local or Cloud Setup**  
   - Containerize the **Fitness Management Agent**.  
   - Integrate with a **wearable/device API** if you have one (Fitbit, Garmin, Apple HealthKit), or mock data if not.  
   - Optionally integrate with a **nutrition or meal plan** API.

2. **LLM Function-Calling**  
   - Tools might include:
     - **GetDailyActivity**(userId)  
     - **SuggestWorkout**(goal, constraints)  
     - **SetGoal**(goalType, targetValue)  
     - **LogWorkout**(type, duration)  
   - Confirm the LLM can parse user instructions (e.g., “I want to lose 5 pounds this month—give me a plan”).

3. **Observability**  
   - **Fitness Management Agent**: Log user’s step counts, workouts, plan suggestions, disclaimers shown, and user confirmations.  
   - **Front-End**: Log final approvals or modifications.

4. **Error Handling**  
   - If the wearable API is unavailable, provide fallback advice (e.g., “Unable to retrieve today’s step count, please try again later.”).

## 6. Possible Enhancements

1. **Personalized AI Coach**  
   - Integrate more advanced analytics or ML to tailor recommendations based on user history, body composition, or heart rate patterns.

2. **Group Challenges**  
   - Extend the system to manage group step challenges or friend competitions, pulling in multiple user data sets and comparing results.

3. **Nutrition and Calorie Tracking**  
   - Combine meal logging and calorie counting with workout data for holistic management of fitness goals.

4. **Gamification**  
   - Provide badges, achievements, or progress visuals to motivate users.  
   - Send weekly or monthly milestone emails (or push notifications) using the **Mail Processing Agent**.

5. **Injury Prevention / Recovery Tips**  
   - Provide basic guidelines or checklists for warm-ups, cooldowns, and safe progress.  
   - Emphasize disclaimers and recommend seeing a medical professional if pain or injuries occur.

6. **Advanced Wearable Integrations**  
   - If the user has heart rate monitors or sleep trackers, tailor workouts based on recovery or sleep quality.
