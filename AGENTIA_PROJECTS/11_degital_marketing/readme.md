# Agentia Digital Marketing Agent Project

Below is a suggested **eleventh project** in your **Agentia** learning path. In this scenario, you will build a **Digital Marketing Campaign Orchestrator Agent** that helps users plan, execute, and track multi-channel marketing campaigns. This new agent will coordinate tasks such as audience targeting, content creation, campaign scheduling, performance monitoring, and budget management—while keeping a **human-in-the-loop** for critical decisions like campaign launches or budget changes.

---

## Project Overview

1. **Goal**  
   - Develop a **Digital Marketing Campaign Orchestrator Agent** that assists with:  
     1. Defining campaign goals, target audiences, budgets, and channels (e.g., email, social media, paid ads).  
     2. Coordinating content creation (messaging, visuals) and scheduling across different platforms.  
     3. Monitoring campaign performance (clicks, conversions, ROI), generating reports, and suggesting optimizations.  
   - Leverage **LLM-based function-calling** to parse user instructions (“Plan a campaign on Facebook for our new product”), integrate with external marketing APIs (real or mock), and generate strategic recommendations (best times to post, potential audience segments).

2. **Key Components**  
   1. **Front-End Orchestration Agent** (existing)  
      - Remains the primary interface for the user’s commands and requests.  
   2. **Greeting Agent** (existing)  
      - Handles trivial greetings or small talk.  
   3. **User Preference Agent** (existing)  
      - Stores user or brand-specific details, such as brand guidelines, typical audiences, marketing budgets, product portfolios.  
   4. **Knowledge Graph Agent** (optional)  
      - Could store relationships among campaigns, target demographics, product lines, marketing channels, or historical performance data.  
   5. **Mail Processing Agent** (optional)  
      - Sends out scheduled campaign updates, performance summaries, or automated marketing emails if needed.  
   6. **Digital Marketing Orchestrator Agent** **(New)**  
      - Integrates with marketing platforms (e.g., social media APIs, email marketing systems, ad networks) to orchestrate multi-channel campaigns.  
      - Uses **LLM** to interpret user instructions, call relevant “tools” for audience targeting, content scheduling, budget adjustments, performance tracking, and more.  
      - Maintains **human oversight** for final approvals on campaign launches, major budget changes, or large-scale ad buys.

3. **Value Proposition**  
   - Demonstrates how **Agentia** can streamline **digital marketing**—coordinating multiple channels and tasks that would otherwise be fragmented.  
   - Highlights advanced **LLM usage** for generating creative messaging ideas, targeting suggestions, and real-time insights.

## 1. Plan the Architecture

1. **Service Layout**  
   - The **Digital Marketing Orchestrator Agent** runs as its own service/container.  
   - It connects to:  
     - **Marketing or advertising platforms** (Facebook Ads, Google Ads, LinkedIn, MailChimp, etc.)—or mock APIs if real integrations are not feasible.  
     - Possibly a **content repository** or asset manager for images, brand visuals, or copy templates.

2. **Communication Patterns**   
   - The Orchestrator Agent’s **LLM-based function-calling** might define tasks such as:  
     - **CreateCampaign**(channel, audience, budget, schedule)  
     - **GenerateAdCopy**(productDescription, targetAudience, tone)  
     - **GetCampaignPerformance**(campaignId)  
     - **AdjustBudget**(campaignId, newBudget)

3. **Human-in-the-Loop**  
   - For final approval of campaign launches, significant budget changes, or major content overhauls, return a **draft** so the user can confirm.  
   - This ensures the user remains in control of high-stakes marketing decisions.

## 2. Digital Marketing Orchestrator Agent

### 2.1 Responsibilities

1. **Campaign Setup and Management**  
   - Prompt for campaign objectives (brand awareness, lead generation, product launch), channels (social, email, paid ads), budget, and timeframe.  
   - Call relevant platform APIs or mock endpoints to set up campaign parameters.

2. **Content Ideation and Scheduling**  
   - Use an **LLM** to propose creative ad copy or social media posts based on user/product info.  
   - Suggest visuals or user-provided images.  
   - Schedule posts/ads at optimal times (guided by platform best practices or the user’s preferences).

3. **Audience Targeting**  
   - Integrate with user preferences or platform insights to select demographics, interests, or lookalike audiences.  
   - Provide a draft target audience (e.g., “People ages 25-40 in the tech industry for a new B2B SaaS product, with an interest in cloud computing”).

4. **Performance Monitoring**  
   - Periodically query each platform’s metrics (impressions, clicks, conversions, CPC, ROI).  
   - Summarize performance in natural language: “Your Facebook ads have a 2.5% click-through rate. Conversions are slightly below target.”  
   - Suggest adjustments—like increasing daily spend, pausing underperforming ads, or experimenting with new copy.

5. **Draft Approval and Execution**  
   - For campaign launch or major changes (doubling the budget, changing the target audience significantly), return a **draft** for the user’s sign-off.  
   - Once approved, finalize changes with the marketing platform.


## 3. Front-End Orchestration Agent: Extended Logic

1. **Identify Marketing Requests**  
   - If the user’s input relates to creating campaigns, scheduling ads, adjusting budgets, or viewing performance, route it to the **Digital Marketing Orchestrator Agent**.  
   - Other requests (greetings, finance, event planning, etc.) go to their respective agents.

2. **Draft Confirmation**  
   - If the Orchestrator returns a draft of an ad campaign or budget plan, the **Front-End** queries the user for approval or modifications.

3. **Fallback**  
   - If the user’s instructions are incomplete (“I want to advertise on social media”), the system can ask clarifying questions (budget, target audience, timeframe, etc.).

---

## 4. Demonstration Scenario

1. **User**: “Hello, I want to run a quick campaign.”  
   - **Front-End** → **Greeting Agent** → “Hi there! What kind of campaign do you have in mind?”  

2. **User**: “We’re launching a new product next week. I have \$1,000 to spend on ads across Facebook and Instagram.”  
   - **Front-End** → **Digital Marketing Orchestrator Agent**.  
   - The agent requests additional details: “Could you provide your product summary, target audience, and any date constraints?”  
   - User responds with “It’s a smartphone accessory, target 25-45 year olds, budget is \$1,000 total, from Monday to Friday.”  
   - The agent calls `CreateCampaign` for both Facebook and Instagram, returning a draft.

3. **User**: “That looks good. Let’s finalize it.”  
   - **Front-End** → Approves → The Orchestrator finalizes the campaigns in the respective (mock) advertising platforms.  
   - The agent confirms: “Campaigns launched! I’ll send you performance updates daily.”

4. **After Two Days**  
   - The system automatically checks performance.  
   - The user asks: “How are my ads doing?”  
   - The Orchestrator calls `GetCampaignPerformance` for each channel, then provides a natural language summary plus suggestions: “Your Instagram ad is doing well with a 3% CTR; Facebook is under 1% CTR—consider adjusting your copy or budget allocation.”

## 5. Deployment and Testing

1. **Local or Cloud Setup**  
   - Containerize the **Digital Marketing Orchestrator Agent**.  
   - Integrate with either a **mock** or **sandbox** marketing API (Facebook/Instagram test environment, Google Ads sandbox, etc.).

2. **LLM Function-Calling**  
   - Tools might include:  
     - **CreateCampaign**(channel, audience, budget, schedule)  
     - **GenerateAdCopy**(brandTone, productDescription, targetAudience)  
     - **GetCampaignPerformance**(campaignId)  
     - **AdjustBudget**(campaignId, newBudget)  
   - Ensure your LLM interprets user instructions effectively and calls these tools with correct parameters.

3. **Observability**  
   - **Digital Marketing Orchestrator Agent**: Log user requests, campaign drafts, performance queries, and final approvals.  
   - **Front-End**: Log user confirmations or modifications.

4. **Error Handling**  
   - If the marketing platform API returns an error (e.g., invalid ad copy, insufficient budget, or date conflict), the system notifies the user.

---

## 6. Possible Enhancements

1. **Advanced Audience Insights**  
   - Integrate analytics or AI-driven audience segmentation to propose new audiences based on brand data or lookalike profiles.

2. **A/B Testing**  
   - Let the agent automatically create multiple ad variations for A/B testing, track results, and pick the best performer.

3. **Multi-Channel Strategy**  
   - Extend beyond social media ads to include email marketing (using the **Mail Processing Agent**), SEO suggestions, or influencer partnerships.

4. **Budget Optimization**  
   - Provide real-time suggestions to reallocate funds among campaigns based on performance, ensuring the best ROI.

5. **Creative Asset Integration**  
   - Connect with a design tool or library to suggest images or templates. The LLM can propose ad text, but you might also want to store images or brand guidelines in a dedicated repository.

6. **Post-Campaign Reporting**  
   - After a campaign ends, automatically generate a detailed ROI report, highlight successes/failures, and recommend next steps.
