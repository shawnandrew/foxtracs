# Agentia Hello World (Greeting Agent) Project

Below is a step-by-step outline for a “Hello World” project in **Agentia**, where you will build two agents:

1. **Front-End Orchestration Agent**  
   - Responsible for receiving a user’s request, delegating that request to other specialized agents, and then consolidating the response back to the user. 
   - **User Interface Layer** The Front-End Agent is what the user interacts with directly (via CLI, web UI, or chatbot interface).

   **Conversation Flow**  
   - **Receive User Input**: Wait for a text message from the user.  
   - **Determine Task**: Identify if the user’s message is a greeting or some other type of request.  
   - **Delegate to Greeting Agent**: If it’s a greeting, forward the message (in natural language form) to the Greeting Agent via its defined endpoint.  
   - **Aggregate Response**: Retrieve the greeting response from the Greeting Agent.  
   - **Return Consolidated Reply**: Send back the combined or processed message to the user.


2. **Greeting Agent**  
   - A specialized agent that handles simple greeting requests (e.g., “Hello,” “How are you?”) and returns a greeting response in natural language.

   **Functionality**  
   - The Greeting Agent responds to simple greeting queries such as “Hello,” “Hi,” “Good morning,” or “How are you?”  
   - If a user message does not match a greeting intent, the agent can respond with a default message (e.g., “I only handle greetings right now.”).

3. **You have a choice of building these Agents for the Agentia World in CrewAI, LangGraph, Microsoft AutoGen version 0.4 and above, and AG2. You may develop anyone of these or develop multiple projects using all of these.**

4. **Testing and Validation**  
   - Manually send a request to the Front-End Agent endpoint 
   - The Front-End Agent should route this message to the Greeting Agent, get a greeting in return, and respond to the user with that greeting.

By completing this minimal, end-to-end demonstration, you’ll gain practical insights into how multi-agent conversations work and how to structure reusable, autonomous components.

### Conclusion

This “Hello World” project is your entry point into **Agentia**, demonstrating how to structure basic agent communication via natural language interfaces, orchestrate their collaboration with a front-end agent, and return a user-friendly response. By following standard industry practices (e.g., microservices, containerization, HTTP/gRPC communication, and simple NLU), you’ll build a strong foundation for more advanced multi-agent systems—where agents can become increasingly specialized, robust, and scalable.
