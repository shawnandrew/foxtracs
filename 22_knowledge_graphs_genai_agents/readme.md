# The Knowledge Graphs, Graph Databases, and The GQL Standard

**What Are Graph Databases?**

Graph databases are specialized database systems designed to store, manage, and query data that is best represented in the form of a graph—that is, as a collection of nodes (also called vertices) and edges (relationships or connections between nodes). Unlike traditional relational databases that use tables and fixed schemas, graph databases emphasize the relationships between data points, making them highly suitable for handling complex, interconnected data.

- **Nodes**: Represent entities or objects, such as people, places, or things.
- **Edges**: Represent relationships or connections between nodes, such as "friend of," "located at," or "purchased."
- **Properties**: Additional information or attributes associated with nodes and edges.

The adoption of graph databases has seen an increase after the rise of generative AI, although the exact correlation is multifaceted. Generative AI models like GPT-4, Llama 3, and others have driven a greater demand for data architectures that can handle complex, interconnected data in more flexible and scalable ways.

## Examples

https://www.nebula-graph.io/posts/An_Comprehensive_Overview_of_the_Standard_Graph_Query_Language

Here are some examples of how you can create and manage property graphs using GQL:

### Creating a Graph
To create a new graph, you can define the graph schema and then instantiate it. For example:

```gql
CREATE GRAPH TYPE socialNetworkSchema (
  Person (name STRING, age INT),
  Friend (since DATE)
);

CREATE GRAPH socialNetwork OF TYPE socialNetworkSchema;
```

### Adding Nodes and Edges
You can add nodes (vertices) and edges (relationships) to the graph:

```gql
INSERT INTO socialNetwork {
  (p1:Person {name: 'Alice', age: 30}),
  (p2:Person {name: 'Bob', age: 25}),
  (p1)-[:Friend {since: DATE '2020-01-01'}]->(p2)
};
```

### Querying the Graph
To query the graph, you can use pattern matching to find specific nodes and relationships:

```gql
MATCH (p:Person)-[f:Friend]->(q:Person)
WHERE p.name = 'Alice'
RETURN p, f, q;
```

### Updating Properties
You can update properties of nodes and edges:

```gql
MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE p.name = 'Alice'
SET p.age = 31;
```

### Deleting Nodes and Edges
To delete nodes and edges, you can use the `DETACH DELETE` command:

```gql
MATCH (p:Person)-[f:Friend]->(q:Person)
WHERE p.name = 'Alice' AND q.name = 'Bob'
DETACH DELETE p, f, q;
```

These examples illustrate some of the basic operations you can perform with GQL to manage property graphs⁶⁵. If you have any specific scenarios or more detailed queries, feel free to ask!
