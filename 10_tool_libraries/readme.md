# Tool Libraries

In the realm of agentic AI, tool libraries like Composio, Browserbase, and Exa play pivotal roles in enhancing the capabilities of AI agents by providing seamless integrations with various applications and services. Here's an overview of these platforms:

**1. Composio:**
Composio is a comprehensive toolset designed to equip AI agents and Large Language Models (LLMs) with over 100 high-quality integrations via function calling. It supports a diverse range of categories, including software applications like GitHub, Notion, Linear, Gmail, Slack, HubSpot, and Salesforce. Additionally, it offers system tools for operating systems, browser functionalities, search capabilities, and software engineering tools such as Ngrok, databases, Redis, Vercel, and Git. Composio also facilitates agentic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for various data types on the fly. It is compatible with multiple agent frameworks like OpenAI, Claude, LlamaIndex, LangChain, CrewAI, Autogen, Gemini, Julep, and Lyzr, allowing for seamless integration in a single line of code. 

**2. Browserbase:**
Browserbase is a specialized tool designed to provide web browsing capabilities for AI agents and applications. It offers a framework for building robust web agents, enabling real-time human-in-the-loop controls through features like Live View for enhanced oversight and flexibility. Browserbase integrates with major AI SDKs, facilitating out-of-the-box functionality for AI agents that require web interaction. 

**3. Exa:**
Exa is a specialized tool that provides web search functionalities for AI agents. It allows agents to perform searches across various platforms, including Google, GitHub, and others, enabling the incorporation of diverse services into AI applications. Exa supports user authentication via OAuth2 and can work in conjunction with other popular frameworks like LangChain and CrewAI, offering flexibility in building innovative AI solutions. 

These tool libraries are integral to the development of sophisticated AI agents, as they provide the necessary integrations and functionalities to perform complex tasks across various platforms and services.
