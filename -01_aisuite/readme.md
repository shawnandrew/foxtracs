# aisuite

aisuite makes it easy for developers to use large language models from multiple providers. When building applications devlopers found it a hassle to integrate with multiple providers. Aisuite lets you pick a "provider:model" just by changing one string, like openai:gpt-4o, anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022, ollama:llama3.1:8b, etc. 

pip install aisuite

pip install 'aisuite[all]'
